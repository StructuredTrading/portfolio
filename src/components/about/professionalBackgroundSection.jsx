            <h3>My background</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I began my professional journey in the dynamic world of financial markets, where I honed my skills in trading and quantitative analysis. My passion for understanding complex market behaviors and developing strategies to navigate them fueled my desire to delve deeper into the technical aspects of trading. This led me to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology with a focus on Full Stack Web Development.</p>
                <p>
                During my studies, I discovered the powerful intersection between technology and finance, and I was inspired to combine my expertise in both fields. I dedicated myself to learning the latest web development technologies, such as React, JavaScript, and the TradingView Pro Charting Library, to create sophisticated, user-friendly trading tools. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Today, I specialize in developing custom trading indicators and platforms that empower traders to make informed decisions. My unique background allows me to understand the needs of traders on a fundamental level, enabling me to craft solutions that are not only technically sound but also strategically impactful.
                </p>
                <p>
                With every project, I strive to bridge the gap between complex financial data and intuitive, accessible interfaces. Whether I’m developing a real-time trading dashboard, integrating APIs, or building a custom trading algorithm, my goal is always the same: to provide powerful, reliable tools that enhance the trading experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                I’m excited to continue evolving in this space, leveraging both my financial and technical expertise to push the boundaries of what’s possible in trading technology.
